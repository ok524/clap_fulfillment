Both UVA and UVB destroy vitamin A in skin , can cause further damaging .
The amount of UV light produced by Sun means that Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light not filtered ous by the almosphere .
In the electronic level , absorption in the ultraviolet and visible portions of the spectrum depends on the electron orbital are spaced such that they can absorb an quantum of light of a specific frequencies , and does not violate selection rules .
Computer modeling of light transmission throught translucent ceramic alumina has shown microscopic pore trapped near grain boundaries act at primary scattering centers .
The states in different material vary in the range from energy that they can absorb .
The attenuation of light of all frequency and wavelengths is due combined mechanisms of absorption and scattering .

Wikipedia is a example o a collaborative editing project on a large scale , which can be both good and bad , because of the large contributions from the public , Wikipedia has one of the widest ranges for material in the world .
The typing might be organized by divides the write into sub-tasks assigned to each group member , with the part first of the tasks done before the next parts , or he or she might work together on each tasks .
Such asynchronous contributions are very efficient in the current time , as group members need not to assemble order to work together .
That is increasing amount of research literature investigating how a collaborative writing can improve learning experiences .
At first , the designers of word processing systems combines existing technologies with emerging ones to develop stand-alone equipment , created a new business distinct to the emerging world of the personally computer .
Word processors do not develop out computer technolology .
Word processing systems would create a lot much more complex and capable text were develop and prices begam to fall , making them more accessibly to the public .

They was found self-esteem is related to the conectivity of frontostriatal circuits , suggesting that feelings of self-worth will emerge from neural systems which integrates information about the self with positive affect and reward .
This circuit is important executive functions including complex problem solving , learn new information , planning ahead , recalling remote memories , responding to appropriate behavior , and chronological ordering by event .

The definitions of old age continue to change , especially as life expectancy in developed countries has risen to beyond 80 years old .
However , the authors ' methods and conclusions drew criticism from the scientific community , who concluded that the study was flawed .
In ancient times , although some strong and healthy people lived until they were over 70 most died before they were 50 .
